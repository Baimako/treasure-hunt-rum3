        <h1><span class="treasure-1">Tresure</span> Island</h1>
        <p>My name is Jim Hawkins, and this is the story of how I once sailed in search of treasure, fought against pirates, and returned alive to tell the tale.</p>
        
        <section class="chapter1">
            <h3>The Map</h3>
            <p>I grew up at the Admiral Benbow Inn, where my parents and I tended travelers along the coast. One day, a rough old seaman named Billy <span class="treasure-2">Bones</span> came to stay. He was a frightening man, scarred and secretive, and he kept a sea chest in his room that he guarded fiercely. He drank rum, sang old sea songs, and paid me a silver coin now and then to keep watch for a <span class="treasure-3">one-legged</span> sailor.

            But Billy was not safe. Strange men came to the inn looking for him, and soon he fell dead, struck down by a stroke. With my mother’s help, I opened his chest to seek the money he owed us. Inside, we found coins, a few trinkets, and—most importantly—a folded sheet of parchment. It was a map.

            Later, when I showed it to our doctor, Dr. Livesey, and to Squire Trelawney, they saw at once what it meant: it was a chart of an island, marked with a red <span class="treasure-4">X</span> and notes about buried treasure. This was Flint’s treasure, hidden by the most feared pirate who had ever sailed the seas. At once, the squire swore we would find it.</p>

            <h3>The Hispaniola</h3>
            <p>The squire purchased a fine ship, the Hispaniola, and hired a captain named Smollett to command her. He also gathered a crew—too hastily, as it turned out. Among them was a one-legged cook called Long John Silver. He was clever, cheerful, and seemed a most able man. I liked him at first, and so did nearly everyone. But there was something in his smile and in the way he whispered with the sailors that made me uneasy.

            It was not until later, when I overheard him speaking to others, that the truth came out: Silver was a pirate, Flint’s own <span class="treasure-5">quartermaster</span>, and half the crew were his men. They planned to mutiny, seize the ship, and take the treasure for themselves.

            I carried this dreadful news to the captain and our friends. We swore to keep our knowledge secret until the right moment.</p>

            <h3>Treasure Island</h3>
            <p>After a long voyage, the island came into view: a wild place of dense forests, rocky hills, and a tall, solitary peak called the <span class ="treasure-6">Spyglass</span>. As soon as land was sighted, Silver’s men grew restless, eager to make their move.

            The captain allowed some of the crew ashore, Silver among them, hoping to delay the mutiny. I slipped into one of the boats and hid. On the island, I saw Silver murder a sailor who would not join him. Horrified, I ran into the woods. There I stumbled upon a ragged man who fell on his knees begging for cheese. His name was Ben Gunn, once a pirate himself, marooned by Flint’s men years before. He had lived alone all that time, half wild, half desperate. But he had a secret: he had already found Flint’s treasure and hidden it in a cave.

            Meanwhile, my friends fortified an old stockade on the shore. From there, they resisted the pirates’ attacks. There were fierce battles, shots fired from muskets, and men wounded on both sides. Silver came under a flag of truce to bargain, but Captain Smollett would not yield.</p>

            <h3>Jim’s Adventures</h3>
            <p>Restless, I struck out on my own one night. By chance, I came upon the Hispaniola, now guarded by only two drunken pirates. In a desperate struggle, I managed to cut the anchor cable and set the ship drifting. After a fight, one pirate lay dead and the other wounded. I lashed the tiller and let the ship beach itself safely in a quiet cove. Exhausted, I made my way back to the stockade.

            But there I found, to my shock, that the fort had been given up to Silver! My companions had bargained with him, hoping to spare lives. I was made a prisoner, though Silver treated me kindly. He knew I was valuable, for I had knowledge he needed.</p>

        <section class="chapter5">
            <h3>The Empty Hole</h3>
            <p>At last, with the map in Silver’s hand, we marched inland to the treasure site. The pirates, greedy and quarrelsome, dug furiously at the spot marked on the map. But instead of gold, they found only an empty pit and broken boards. Flint’s treasure had been moved!

            A cry went up, and rage turned the pirates against Silver and me. At that moment, shots rang out from the trees—Dr. Livesey, the squire, and Ben Gunn appeared. The pirates fled in terror, and those who survived were soon scattered.

            Silver, quick as ever, joined us, pretending he had been on our side all along. And in truth, we did not expose him, for without him the other pirates might still have prevailed.</p>

        <section class="chapter6">
            <h3>The Treasure</h3>
            <p>Ben Gunn then revealed what he had done: years ago, he had found Flint’s hoard and carried it piece by piece to his hidden cave. We went there and saw it with our own eyes—mountains of gold coins, bars of silver, and jewels, more wealth than I could imagine.

            It took days to carry it aboard the Hispaniola. At last, with the treasure secure, we set sail for home. Silver helped with the work, always smiling, always watchful. Then one night, as we stopped at a port for supplies, he slipped away in a boat, taking a small share of the treasure with him. We never saw him again.</p>

        <section class="chapter7">
            <h3>Home Again</h3>
            <p>So we came back to England at last, rich beyond measure. Captain Smollett retired from the sea, Dr. Livesey returned to his patients, and Ben Gunn was rewarded with a small portion, which he soon spent.

            As for me, I have sworn never to go to sea in search of treasure again. Yet sometimes in my dreams I still hear the surf on Treasure Island, the cry of gulls, and the echo of the old pirates’ song:

            “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”

            And I wake with a shudder, for I know the sea will always haunt me.</p>
